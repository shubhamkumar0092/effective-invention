
JavaScript is Case Sensitive:
   The variables lastName and lastname, are two different variables.
   
JavaScript Data Types

In JavaScript there are 5 different data types that can contain values:

    string
    number
    boolean
    object
    function

There are 3 types of objects:

    Object
    Date
    Array

And 2 data types that cannot contain values:

    null
    undefined


JavaScript can "display" data in different ways:

    Writing into an HTML element, using innerHTML.
    Writing into the HTML output using document.write().
    Writing into an alert box, using window.alert().
    Writing into the browser console, using console.log().

JavaScript ignores multiple spaces
  The following lines are equivalent:
     var person = "Hege";
     var person="Hege";
	 
Allowed 
    a = 5; b = 6; c = a + b;
	
JavaScript Values
	Fixed values are called "LITERALS". Variable values are called "VARIABLES".
	
Strings are text, written within double or single quotes: "Shubham" or 'Shubham'

Comments :
   Code after double slashes // or between /* and */ is treated as a comment.
   
   // This is a comment
   /*This is also  a comment*/
   /* This is a multi line 
     comment*/

JavaScript Identifiers:

All JavaScript variables must be identified with unique names. These unique names are called identifiers.

Operators:

!== 	       not equal value or not equal type
=== 	       equal value and equal type
== 	           equal to
!= 	           not equal

typeof    	   Returns the type of a variable
instanceof 	   Returns true if an object is an instance of an object type

JavaScript Objects: 
      var person = {firstName:"John", lastName:"Doe", age:50, eyeColor:"blue"};
The object (person) in the example above has 4 properties: firstName, lastName, age, and eyeColor.


Difference Between Undefined and Null:
Undefined and null are equal in value but different in type:

typeof undefined           // undefined
typeof null                // object

null === undefined         // false
null == undefined          // true
