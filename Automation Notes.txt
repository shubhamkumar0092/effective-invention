smoke and sanity testing ---->>>>>
Smoke testing(Build Verification Testing) is a wide approach where all areas of the software application are tested without getting into too deep.  The results of this testing is used to decide if a build is stable enough to proceed with further testing.
However, a sanity software testing is a narrow regression testing with a focus on one or a small set of areas of functionality of the software application.

skip a @Test method from execution in TestNG?
throw new SkipException("Skipping - This is not ready for testing ");

30. What is the use of @Test(invocationCount=x)?

The invocationcount attribute tells how many times TestNG should run a test method
@Test(invocationCount = 10)
public void testCase1(){
//code
}

31. What is the use of @Test(threadPoolSize=x)?

The threadPoolSize attribute tells to form a thread pool to run the test method through multiple threads.
Note: This attribute is ignored if invocationCount is not specified
@Test(threadPoolSize = 3, <code class="plain">invocationCount = </code><code class="value">10</code>) 
public void testCase1(){
//code
}

32. What does the test timeout mean in TestNG?

The maximum number of milliseconds a test case should take.
@Test(threadPoolSize = 3, invocationCount = 10,  timeOut = 10000)
public void testCase1(){
//code
}
